            <h1 class="header"><u>Who Am I?</u></h1>
            <p class="para">My name is Alex Couch. I created this website as a means to help people
            with PC issues, though not only limited to just PC (Windows). I am 18 years old. I attend Post Falls High
            School in Post Falls, Idaho. I also attend KTEC (Kootenai Technical Education Campus) in Rathdrum, Idaho.
            I am a Senior this year and I am currently applying for Eastern Washington University to earn my Bachelor's
            Degree in Computer Science. I am learning various programming languages and the result of that is this
            website. I also am learning to make applications and, eventually, games. I've wanted to make games since I
            was little.

            <h1 class="header"><u>My Personal Life</u></h1>
            <p class="para">I live with my parents, being my mom and my dad, and I also live with my grandfather, in Newman Lake,
            Washington. I have two dogs, very fat beagles to be more precise. Their names are Rosco and Lucy. I have
            a Rose-Haired Tarantula named Rose, and my dad has an Albino Corn Snake named Snow. I have a brother who is
            14 years old. I have a girlfriend, who I have been with for over a month now.

            <h1 class="header"><u>My Computer Experience</u></h1>
            <p>I started taking computers apart when I was 14 years old. I began to code around the same time. My first
            programming language was a language that is not very commonly seen or even heard of: BlitzBasic. I then
            began to start coding mods (modifications) for a game called Minecraft when I was 15 in a language called
            Java. I continued to learn Java up to this time. When I was 15 I also started taking a class in high school
            that taught me to make websites. XHTML and CSS were then my next programming languages. When I was 17, I
            started learning other languages such as Python, Lua, C/C++, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and Assembly. I also
            began to take a Computer Repair class in KTEC at 17, which I am currently taking. I starting making this
            website at this time. I had a lot of fun making this website and I look forward to making other websites
            and applications in the future.
